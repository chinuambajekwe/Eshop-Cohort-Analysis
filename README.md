# Eshop-Cohort-Analysis

Situation: E-Shop Pro is facing a significant challenge in retaining its customers. While the company has been successful in acquiring new customers through marketing efforts and promotions, it has noticed a concerning trend of declining customer retention rates. This is a critical issue in the highly competitive e-commerce industry, where customer loyalty and repeat business are paramount.


Task: Create a cohort analysis tool that shows how different cohorts perform and behave over their entire lifecycle, allowing the business to understand their customer retention, engagement, and revenue generation patterns.

"""The line plot above shows the company's monthly sales trend from December 2010 to December 2011.

December 2010 saw a gradual decline in the quantiity of products sold which persisted till the end of January 2011.
In February, product demand picked up, increasing sales by about 50% till March. This spike was shortlived as March 
sales plunged by 30%.

Nonetheless , sales rose slightly to about 1.4 million in May, maintaining this streak till August 2011.

In August, a sharp spike in quantitities sold in August is observed with consistent increases in the following months. 
This upward sales trend peaks in Novemeber shooting sales close to 4 million.

A drastic turn of events emerges the following month (December 2011) with sales values tanking to 500,000, 
the lowest figure for the entire period 

It is worth investigating what caused sudden rise in products sales between August and November  2011 and 
unpredecented plunge in December 2011

Between December 2010 and January 2011, there was a steady decline in the number of products sold. 
However, demand rebounded in February, leading to a 50% increase in sales through March. 
This surge was brief, as sales dropped by 30% by the end of March.

Despite this setback, sales saw a modest rise to 1.4 million units in May, and this level remained 
consistent through August 2011. A sharp increase in product sales occurred in August, continuing upward 
in the following months. This growth peaked in November, with sales approaching 4 million units.

In December 2011, however, sales dramatically plummeted to 500,000 units— the lowest figure for the 
entire period. Further investigation is needed to understand the factors behind the significant sales 
increase between August and November 2011, as well as the sudden drop in December 2011.



# Cohort Analysis 

![plot5](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3ffbc59f-d247-4896-8ca1-9625e3dfddd0)
The cohort table provides insight into retention rates, showing the percentage of customers who returned after 
their initial purchase. 

The cohort index represents the number of months between a customer’s first purchase and their most recent one. 

For cohort index 1, it reflects the number of customers who made their first purchase in that month, while cohort 
index 2 shows the percentage of those customers who made repeat purchases out of the total customers acquired.

During the analysis period, the December 2010 cohort had the highest retention rate, with 50% of customers still 
making purchases as of November 2011. 

In contrast, the April 2011 cohort had the lowest retention rate, with only 8% of customers returning to buy from 
the brand six months after their initial acquisition.

# Recommendation
The business team should investigate the marketing strategies used in December 2010, as they contributed to strong 
customer loyalty, and consider replicating or adjusting those efforts to improve future retention rates. 

Similarly, it’s essential to examine what tactics led to the low retention in April 2011, so the team can avoid those pitfalls 
and enhance customer retention moving forward.
